					<h3>Lesson 1<h3>
					<h4>Talk to Chella</h4>
					<p>As the lesson implies, you need to talk to Chella to start this lesson. Might as well do so as soon as you’re back downstairs. She wants you to learn to disguise yourself, so grab some ashes from the oven (no, seriously) and get ready to hunt for some beggar’s rags.</p>
					<h5>Option 1: Find a Beggar and Take His Clothes</h5>
					<p>Finding a beggar is actually pretty difficult in the harbor district. Listen for the sound of “alms for the blind” and you’ll know you’re in the right place. You can give a coin to the beggar, but don’t waste your cash. He will demand 50 GP for his clothes and a set of sturdy clothes from Gaston the tailor. Or, if you’re broke, you can arrange an alternative method of payment.</p>
					<p>You can also intimidate him at this point, but I would recommend doing so out of sight of the Dhorn patrol.</p>
					<p>If you take his suggestion and let him feel you up out of sight of the Dhorn patrol, things don't exactly go according to plan.</p>
					<div id="ability-check">
						<p><b>Ability Check: Gentle Persuasions</b></p>
						<p><b>Discipline:</b> Meet a DC 4 or better on your Discipline skill to pleasure the homeless dude, because boy does he <b>reek</b>. 40 EXP for going through with this.</p>
						<p><b>Intimidate:</b> Threaten him with the Knife You Always Have On You™, DC 7 for 70 EXP and all the rags your heart desires. Also a point of Evil.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Of course, if you refuse to do either after letting him feel you up, or you suck him off to no avail, you are accosted by a man named Fino, who gets the clothes for you if you’re polite.</p>
					<p id="nota-bene"><b>Nota bene:</b> Fino is critical to starting the <a href="../../sq/nightingale.html">Nightingale</a> questline. If you want to pursue it, it <b>pays</b> to be polite! (Wink wink, nudge nudge.)</p>
