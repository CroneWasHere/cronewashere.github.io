					<p>A few months have gone by in hiding. After the Princess gives a bit of exposition on everyone she’s been working with, you’re finally granted control of your movement.</p>

					<h3>The Bear Pit: the Kitchens</h3>
					<p>You start in yours and Trissa’s room. There’s a commode and a wash basin if you’re feeling fresh. There’s nothing in your chest right now, and the chest of drawers is for changing your shoes, stockings, and panties. Trissa’s armoire is locked but can be opened with a DC 28 Open Lock skill check (you’ll take 20 if you’re not in combat) and has her clothing and a pair of thigh-highs. You can take these if you want to be that kind of princess. Her clothes grant a whopping +2 bonus to Charisma.</p>
					<p>When you try to leave the room for the first time, Trissa bursts in. If you’re wearing her clothes, she’ll bitch you out about it. Otherwise, she’ll bitch you out about not being awake earlier, and warn you away from Caron. Overall she’s just generally unhappy.</p>
					<p>Now that you know you must absolutely talk to Caron, go ahead and keep exploring.</p>
					<p>The next room has the bath, which is actually a plot point, believe it or not. The room beyond that belongs to Chella, and her armoire holds a Very Nice Dress™ that bumps Persuade +1.</p>
					<p>Heading out to the kitchen, talk to Chella. If you decided against wearing panties today, she’ll comment on it (creep!). She’ll also tell you that Master Nathan wishes to speak with you ASAP. Trying to leave at this point is impossible as the door is plot-locked and the house guard is standing right there. On your way upstairs, Caron will automatically stop you for a chit-chat, despite your most sincere promises to Trissa that you would stop talking to him. He quickly establishes himself as Love Interest #1.</p>
					<p>Go upstairs and talk to Master Nathan.</p>

					<h3>The Bear Pit: Nathan’s Rooms</h3>
					<p>Not much to loot here, by which I mean there is nothing. Talking to Master Nathan will prompt a plot-relevant discussion of how your situation is going to change. He’s assigning you seven lessons on learning the trade, as it were. Talk to him again and you can ask if he knows what Vico did, or even fruitlessly ask for money. Choices!</p>
