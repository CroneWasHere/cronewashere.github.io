					<h3>Getting Scouted</h3>
					<h2>Talk to Fino</h2>
					<p>Fino isn't someone you can just find; he only appears if you fail to recover the beggar's clothing in the harbor district. Upon breaking contact with the beggar, Fino will approach you and question your motives. If you're polite and well-meaning (even if you are a <em>bit</em> guarded), Fino will recover the beggar's clothes for you and offer you a business opportunity.</p>
					<p id="nota-bene"><b>Nota bene:</b> If you do not agree to his business proposal, no clothes for you! This can lead to a softlock on <a href="../mq/lessons/one.html">Lesson One</a> if you already alienated Gaston. A savvy Princess keeps her options open.</p>
					<p>If you agree to his proposition, you can meet him in this very district at his home, 19 Lark Street.
